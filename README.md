My version of an LCD display based on a ST7565. I wanted something to display stuff rather than using a browser.

I was going to get the Jeelabs LCD, to use with the GLCDlib is a graphics library for 128x64 displays based on the ST7565. But the EmonGLCD kit from openenergymonitor.org, was more self contained and had buttons, so I decided to get that instead. I know I could of added buttons. But I wanted a more complete unit feel.

This is the firmware I am using on my non-solar setup to display. Power, Weather, Time and Power Usage History (Modified). It is mainly modified from the OpenEnergyMonitor branch.

Need to decide what to use the LEDs for yet.
